    "# 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Image Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "In todayâ€™s digital age, the proliferation of high-resolution images and videos has led to an increasing demand for efficient storage and transmission methods. Image compression plays a crucial role in reducing the file size of images without significantly compromising quality. This enables faster transmission over networks, efficient storage utilization, and improved performance in image processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional image compression methods like JPEG have been widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, with advancements in technology and the need for higher compression ratios and better image quality, more sophisticated algorithms have been developed. This evolution has led to the creation of JPEG 2000, a more advanced image compression standard that overcomes many limitations of its predecessors (still an old algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JPEG 2000?\n",
    "\n",
    "JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard and coding system created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee in the year 2000. It was designed to provide a flexible and efficient method for compressing images, offering both lossy and lossless compression within a single unified framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features and Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    " - Wavelet-Based Compression: Unlike JPEG, which uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), JPEG 2000 employs the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), leading to better compression efficiency and image quality, especially at high compression ratios.\n",
    " - Scalability: Supports progressive decoding by pixel accuracy and resolution, enabling applications to display lower-quality versions of an image while higher-quality data is still being transmitted.\n",
    " - Region of Interest (ROI) Coding: Allows certain parts of an image to be coded with higher quality than the rest, which is beneficial in applications where specific areas need to be emphasized.\n",
    " - Error Resilience: Enhanced robustness to data transmission errors, making it suitable for unreliable network environments.\n",
    " - Lossless and Lossy Compression: Provides both compression methods in a single algorithm, eliminating the need for separate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    " - Medical Imaging: High-quality lossless compression is essential for diagnostic purposes.\n",
    " - Digital Cinema: Efficient compression without compromising image quality is critical for movie distribution.\n",
    " - Satellite and Remote Sensing: Handles large images with high resolutions effectively.\n",
    " - Archival Storage: Preservation of digital images with minimal loss in quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    " - Understand the Core Components: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the JPEG 2000 compression pipeline, including pre-processing, transformation, quantization, and encoding.\n",
    " - Explore the Discrete Wavelet Transform: Learn how DWT differs from other transforms and why it is advantageous for image compression.\n",
    " - Implement Key Algorithms: Use Python to implement and experiment with the main algorithms used in JPEG 2000.\n",
    " - Visualize Compression Effects: Observe how different parameters affect image quality and compression efficiency through interactive visualizations.\n",
    " - Customize for Specific Data: Learn how to adapt and optimize the JPEG 2000 algorithm for different types of images and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Notebook is Structured\n",
    "\n",
    " - Section 1-2: Introduce fundamental concepts and pre-processing steps to set the stage for the core compression techniques.\n",
    " - Section 3-5: Delve into the core components of JPEG 2000, providing both theoretical background and practical implementations.\n",
    " - Section 6-7: Discuss the reconstruction process and evaluate the performance of the compression.\n",
    " - Section 8-9: Explore advanced topics and customization options to extend your understanding and application of JPEG 2000.\n",
    " - Interactivity and Modularity: Throughout the notebook, interactive elements allow you to experiment with parameters and observe outcomes in real-time, and modular sections enable focused learning on topics of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid understanding of how JPEG 2000 works and be equipped with practical skills to implement and customize the algorithm for various applications."
